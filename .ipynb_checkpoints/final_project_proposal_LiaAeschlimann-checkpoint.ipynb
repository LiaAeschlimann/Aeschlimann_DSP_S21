The marks show the performance of the students in three different subjects (measured with three tests): math, reading and writing. Further there are a variety of personal, social, and economic factors that might have interaction effects upon the school perfromance. The dataset is fictional."

Therefore I'm going to have a look at the influence on personal, social and economic factors, such as the gender, parental level of education, ethnicity, socio economic status (assessed over \"lunch\"; free/reduced or standard prices, which is related to parents income)and test-preparation. \n",

    "> [VP] - Proposal approved. Mixed-effects modeling is not appropriate, as you only have 1 observation per participant and class - the three classes are different variables, not 3 different measurements of the same variable. It would be best to just use linear regression. All of your predictors are categorical, which is not ideal. But here's a suggestion. You can code the \"Parental level of education\" with ranks 1 = some high school, 2= high school, 3= some college, 4=bachelor's degree, 5=master's degree, and then you can treat that as a continuous predictor. And yes, you can use something like 10-fold cross-validation with this dataset - you'll see how when we get to that topic."
